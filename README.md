# 11073PhdApplication

This project is a free and open-source implementation of Personal Health Devices (PHD) for Castalia Simulator. We adapt the Antidote Library to work on Castalia, and implemented five different PHDs to act like real ISO/IEEE 11073 devices in a Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN) simulation. Our application also supports the sender require or not a confirmation from the receiver. This code supports both agent and manager-initiated measurements.
