# 11073PhdApplication

This project is a free and open-source implementation of Personal Health Devices (PHD) for Castalia Simulator. We adapt the [Antidote Library](https://github.com/conqlima/Antidote) to work on Castalia, and implemented five different PHDs to act like real ISO/IEEE 11073 devices in a Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN) simulation. Our application also supports the sender require or not a confirmation from the receiver. This code supports both agent and manager-initiated measurements.

For a better understanding, please read the **Health informatics — Personal health device communication -  Part 20601: Application profile — Optimized exchange protocol**.
